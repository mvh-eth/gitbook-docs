# Decision 2 - What collections are the best to buy from?

It is important to be selective with what collections the DAO buys from. A select group of 5 collections will be chosen each day by the algorithm based on a number of parameters:

* Has the collection been established for over 3 months with an average of over 10 sales per day?
* Total volume in the last week
* Total number of sales in the last week
* How many NFTs within the collection are listed?
* Has the floor price been constant?
