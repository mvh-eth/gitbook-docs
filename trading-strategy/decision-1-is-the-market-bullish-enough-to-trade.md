# Decision 1 - Is the market bullish enough to trade?

The decision that the market is good enough to trade will have to be reached before any trading decisions will be made by the DAO on a daily basis, whether it is to buy or to sell. This decision will be dependant on a number of different factors

* Market Sentiment
* ETH price
* Number of active traders
* Overall volume

### Market Sentiment

This value is calculated from volatility, trading volume, social media data and google trends. A score of over 50% will indicate that now is a good time to trade.

A sudden change in the score will also indicate that now is not a good time to trade



### ETH price

This metric will be focused on the change in ETH price, since when the ETH price is stable the NFT market tends to trade more reliably.



### How many active traders are there

The number of people currently trading NFTS is an important metric to consider, if the number of people trading is beginning to decline, to may be necessary to pause the DAO

### &#x20;Overall volume
