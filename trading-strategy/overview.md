# Overview

### What is NFT Vision

NFT Vision is a protocol that makes fully-automated data-driven NFT trading decisions. Utilising machine-learning models NFT Vision is able to identify optimal trades and snipe NFTs. This decision is split into 4 specific components

1. Is the market bullish enough to trade
2. What collections to buy from
3. What NFT's to buy
4. HODL duration&#x20;

The liquidity of the DAO will be used to make automated trading decisions based off the data driven trading decision provided through the proprietary NFT Vision machine learning algorithms.&#x20;



### Trading strategies

The DAO will implement a default trading strategy, This will be targeted at quick profit flips. Aiming to not hold a single NFT for longer than 1 week, This can be achieved by only buying into collections with high sustained volume over time.

> Implementing a range of different trading strategies will be possible over time

### How will the algorithm decide when to buy

Threshold values are programmed into the DAO for when decisions are to be made, for example if the market has been trending up for 1 week and MAYC has maintained a period of high volume for 5 day then the algorithm has detected a new listings at 15% under its predicted price then the profitably threshold is reached and a buy is triggered

### How will the algorithm decide when to sell

Since the NFT Vision trading strategy is to flip NFTs quickly the algorithm will predict a fair market price based on recent sales for an NFT with simular traits and the current market direction
