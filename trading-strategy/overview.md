# Overview

### What is NFT Vision

NFT Vision is a protocol that makes fully-automated, data-driven NFT trading decisions. Utilising machine learning models, NFT Vision is able to identify optimal trades and snipe NFTs. The decision of what to buy is consists of 4 specific components

1. Is the market bullish enough to trade?
2. What collections are the best to buy from?
3. Which NFT's should be brought?
4. How long do you keep the NFT for after it has been brought?

The liquidity of the DAO will be used to make automated trading decisions based off the data-driven trading decision provided through the proprietary NFT Vision machine learning algorithms.&#x20;

### Trading strategies

The DAO will implement a default trading strategy, which will be to target quick profit flips. The aim is that a single NFT will not be held for longer than 1 week, this will be achieved by only buying into collections with high sustained volume over time.

> Implementing a range of different trading strategies will be possible over time

### How will the algorithm decide when to buy?

Threshold values are programmed into the DAO for when decisions are to be made. For example, the market has been trending up for 1 week and MAYC has maintained a period of high volume for 5 days, the algorithm detects a new listing at 15% under its predicted price value, which means the profitability threshold is reached and a buy is triggered

### How will the algorithm decide when to sell?

Since the NFT Vision trading strategy is to flip NFTs quickly, the algorithm will predict a fair market price based on recent sales for an NFT with similar traits and the current market direction
